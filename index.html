            <p>Welcome to Embodied Social Work, where traditional social work practice meets cutting-edge somatic approaches. I specialize in helping individuals reconnect with their innate capacity for healing through evidence-informed interventions that address trauma, anxiety, and stress where they live - in the body.</p>
            <p>My practice is grounded in an understanding of neurobiology and the understanding that our bodies hold our experiences. By working with both mind and body simultaneously, we can create deeper, more sustainable healing than through talk therapy alone.</p>
            <p>With an education in nervous system regulation, trauma recovery, and somatic awareness, I offer a unique integration of approaches tailored to your individual needs, cultural background, and personal goals.</p>

            <p>I believe that healing happens not just through insight, but through embodied experience. By reconnecting with the wisdom that lives within your body, you can develop a deeper understanding of yourself and create lasting change.</p>

                        Working with Liz has transformed my relationship with my body. For years, I tried traditional talk therapy without making much progress. Learning to listen to my body's signals through her somatic approach has helped me understand my anxiety in ways I never could before. I now have practical tools to regulate my nervous system when I feel overwhelmed.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What exactly is somatic work?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Somatic work is a body-centered approach to healing that recognizes the profound connection between mind and body. Unlike traditional talk therapy, which focuses primarily on thoughts and emotions, somatic interventions directly engage with physical sensations, movement patterns, and nervous system states. By working with the body's innate wisdom, somatic approaches help address trauma, stress, and emotional challenges that are stored in the body, not just the mind.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Do I need previous body awareness experience?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Not at all! Many clients come to somatic work with limited body awareness, and developing this connection is actually part of the process. I meet you wherever you are in your journey and provide gentle guidance to help you build your capacity for embodied awareness at a pace that feels comfortable and safe for you.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">How is this different from traditional therapy?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Traditional talk therapy primarily engages the cognitive, thinking part of your brain. While this can be valuable and is typically used in conjuction with somatic interventions, talk therapy alone sometimes misses the physical aspects of our experiences - especially with trauma, which affects our nervous system and bodily responses. Somatic approaches integrate body awareness, movement, breath, and nervous system regulation with cognitive understanding, creating a more comprehensive pathway to healing. This bottom up approach can often lead to deeper, more sustainable change than talk therapy alone.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Will I have to talk about my trauma in detail?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>No, and this is one of the key benefits of somatic work. Rather than requiring detailed retelling of traumatic experiences, which can sometimes be retraumatizing, somatic approaches focus on how trauma manifests in your body today. We work with present-moment sensations, movement patterns, and nervous system responses, allowing healing to occur without necessarily revisiting the specifics of difficult experiences.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">I have mobility limitations. Can I still benefit from somatic work?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Absolutely! Somatic work is adaptable to all bodies and abilities. The foundation of this approach is connecting with sensation and building awareness, which can be done in any position and with any level of mobility. I tailor all interventions to meet your specific needs and physical abilities, whether that means seated practices, micro-movements, or even visualization techniques. Many clients with chronic pain, limited mobility, or disabilities find somatic approaches particularly valuable because they emphasize working with the body you have, rather than imposing external standards of movement or ability.</p>

                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">How much time do I need to commit to see results? I'm already busy.</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>I understand that time is precious, and somatic work is designed to integrate into your life, not add another burden. Many of the most effective somatic techniques take only minutes to practice and can be incorporated into daily activities you're already doing. While regular sessions support deeper change, we'll focus on practical, accessible tools that fit your lifestyle. Many clients report noticing subtle shifts after just a few sessions, though more sustainable changes typically develop over time. Remember that even brief moments of embodied awareness throughout your day can create meaningful change in your nervous system regulation and overall well-being.</p>
